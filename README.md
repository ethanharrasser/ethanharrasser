# About Me

I'm a software engineer hailing from northern California with experience developing full stack web applications. I'm proficient in JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, React/Redux, Express, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS, and I'm currently learning Rust and Astro. I have built multiple full stack projects, both solo and as a team member: vibrato, a Reverb.com inspired music gear e-commerce site; and fairshare, a Splitwise clone for splitting up payments, developed collaboratively. While I am perfectly capable and happy working across the stack, I do have an interest in UI/UX and graphic design, so frontend work is especially enjoyable!

I'm also a music composer and performer! My primary instrument is guitar, but I also can play keys at a modest level and love sound design with synthesizers and effects pedals. I enjoy writing orchestral scores for visual media such as film, television, and video games, and hope to one day write and publish a full soundtrack.

I completed an Associate of Arts Degree in Music at Butte College with no prior experience reading or writing music, and have composed full orchestral scores for live performance, as well as performing as a guitarist for multiple ensembles. More recently, I completed App Academy's full-time, 24-week program to kickstart my career as a software engineer. I look forward to learning more and improving my skills in software development far into the future, and potentially learning video game development as a hobby.

Most importantly, if you need somebody to nerd out about music, guitars, synths, effects pedals, coffee, video games, or worldbuilding, here I am!
